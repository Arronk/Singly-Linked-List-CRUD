# Singly-Linked-List-CRUD
A little project I did to learn singly linked lists and pointers

The program has basic CRUD operations. Even though I know linked lists aren't really designed to be sorted, as this slows insertion and search is still linear, this was requested by a collegue who handed me the challenge.

I didn't want  to go far with the user input controls but there are controls to not allow input for action items that are numbered on the main menu and duplicate driver Id's are not allowed to name a couple.

If somebody else learning linked lists stumbles across this and needs a hand please feel free to contact me at:

Thanks!
