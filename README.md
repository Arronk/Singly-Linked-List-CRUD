# Singly-Linked-List-CRUD
A little project I did to learn some basic data structures using C.

- The SLL program files are: mystruct.h and sll.h
- The Hashtable program files are: swanhash.c and hashstruct.h

The two programs have basic CRUD operations. Even though I know singly linked lists aren't really designed to be sorted (as this slows insertion whilst search remains linear) this was requested by a collegue who handed me the challenge. The integer hashing function was found on stackoverflow which is linked in the code comments. 

I didn't want  to go far with the user input controls but there are controls to not allow input for action items that are not numbered on the main menu and duplicate driver Id's are not allowed to name a couple.

If somebody else learning linked lists or hashtables stumbles across this and needs a hand please feel free to contact me at:

Thanks!
